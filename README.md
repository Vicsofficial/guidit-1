## AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

# GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
# WHEN I view the source code
# THEN I find semantic HTML elements
# WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
# THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
# WHEN I view the icon and image elements
# THEN I find accessible alt attributes
# WHEN I view the heading attributes
# THEN they fall in sequential order
# WHEN I view the title element
# THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

----------

## Below are the updates made to accomplish the given task:

# Corrected the H2 tag in the footer to H4
# Added a Nav tag and nested the nav links in it
# Added the alt tags to the images for accessibility
# Appropriately indented and cleaned the code for readability
# Corrected the closing tag in the link tag for the stylesheet
